## Overview

### The Project
We created a landing page for a Coding School company called CodeStudio. The page is fully responsive and was built using HTML and CSS.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What we learned
We learned how to create a landing page using HTML and CSS. We also learned how to make the page responsive using media queries. Some of the things we learned include:
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Responsive design

Some code snippets :

```html
<p class="quote-block__text">
 Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and
 I learn.
 </p>
```

```css
 .scroll-to-top {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: var(--background-color-light);
  border: 3px solid var(--active-color);
  border-radius: 50px;
  margin: 0 15px 15px 0;
  padding: 4px 0;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}
 
```

### Useful resources
- [Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped us understand how to use flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Media queries ](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped us finally understand media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

### Continued development
We would like to continue learning about responsive design and how to make our pages more interactive. We would also like to learn more about JavaScript and how to use it to make our pages more interactive.
